# Family Matching

Originally written to match BU UPE members into "families" (groups/teams) based on responses to a survey.

To create new families, use ```match_families```, add the survey .csv file to directory and run all. Please note that the survey must contain only Yes/No questions.

To match new members into existing families, use ```match_new_members``` and supply survey responses as shown in the notebook.
